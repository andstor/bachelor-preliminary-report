\chapter{Attitudes}
As a computer engineer, one is expected to behave responsible and professional. One should be curious of new technology and strive to provide the best solutions possible. Further, one should take proud in ones own work and feel a certain responsibility of the work that is done. 

In a world that is becoming increasingly smaller, good collaboration is essential. In the role as a computer engineer, it is expected that one will come into contact and collaborate with persons from many different disciplines. It is therefore vital to have open mindsets and welcome new ideas. Discussions are to be expected. However, disagreements should be kept factual and handled respectfully.

The development of software is often a large part of the job as a computer engineer. Software has potential to affect human lives. Either directly or indirectly. The creation of software should therefore be rooted in strong ethics and respect for the users privacy. With this in mind, open source is a great way of achieving both transparency and openness. Today, everything revolves around profit. Companies are doing everything from charging huge amounts for proprietary software, to profiting on your personal information. However, open source has become a popular platform in which people can collaborate on software projects. By join forces and helping one another, one can achieve truly great things.
