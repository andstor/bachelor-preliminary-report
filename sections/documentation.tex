\chapter{Documentation}
\section{Reports and technical documents}
Firstly, a progress report shall be created for every two weeks. Secondly, documentation for the various systems will be produced. In order to make a successful software project, good documentation is imperative. A lot of this documentation will mainly be automatically generated by JSDoc. The automation will be integrated in the workflow of a new version release of a system (GitHub repository). This ensures the validity of the documentation, as well as ensures future maintenance. This integration will be provided by a GitHub action, also to be a part of this project. The generated documentation will be publicly available, hosted at GitHub Pages. Lastly, various UML diagrams will be created. These will serve as illustration for the relationship between the various systems.

As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:project-control-assets}, internal documentation will be kept private in Jira and Confluence. Documents of public interest will be placed publicly available on GitHub.
