\section*{Summary}

This preliminary report concerns the plans and preparations for a bachelor's thesis at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The purpose of the thesis is to improve and further develop the already existing open source project named Voxelizer. Voxelizer is a JavaScript engine for converting 3D models into a volumetric representation, a process known as voxelization.

The engine needs to be refined, professionalized, and extended. To ease the use of the engine, a cross platform desktop application and a command line interface will be developed. In order to make the Voxelizer engine and the complementary software easy to maintain, the projects will have a focus on automation. Especially, a GitHub action will be developed for automating the generation of JavaScript documentation.

%Here you give a summary of your your work and your results. This is like a management summary and should be written in a clear and easy language, without many difficult terms and without abbreviations. Everything you present here must be treated in more detail in the main report. You should not give any references to the report in the summary -- just explain what you have done and what you have found out. The Summary and Conclusions should be no more than two pages.
