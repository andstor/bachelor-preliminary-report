\chapter{Planned meetings and reports}

\section{Meetings}
A meeting with the advisor will be held every two weeks. These meetings will be used for reporting on the current progress. The meetings are an opportunity of gathering constructive feedback from the supervisor. Further, they will serve as documentation for working both professionally and responsible.

\section{Progress reports}
Progress reports will be developed up-front of each meeting. These will describe what activities were planned, and what activities were actually seen through. If any deviations from the plan occurred during the period, these should also be included in the progress report. The report will be sent to the supervisor at least a day before the meetings. This will form the basis for the matters to be discussed at the meetings.
